# Image-classification-cats-dogs
The Image Classification - Cats vs. Dogs project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the project preprocesses the dataset by resizing and normalizing images, then trains the model to accurately classify new images. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and precision, ensuring it can reliably predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog. This project serves as a practical introduction to image classification and deep learning techniques.
